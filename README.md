# Naive Bayes, MAP, PCA, MDS, and ISOMAP

## About
This project was done during my time studying in the CS 340: Machine Learning course run by Dr. Mike Gelbart and co. Much of the base code can be attributed to him and his team. Implementations of the listed items were done by Matthew Hounslow.

## Contents

In this repo you will find working implementations of Naive Bayes, PCA (Robust, Alternative), MDS, ISOMAP using k-nearest neighbours. All code is written in Python 3.6. Sklearn's classifiers were also used here.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- Sklearn
- scipy
- matplotlib

## Running the project

In order to run the project, use `python3 main.py -q <topic-number>` where <topic-number> represents the section in main.py. Each section number pertains to a different technique in this case. More comments will be added to these files down the line to give greater clarity.
